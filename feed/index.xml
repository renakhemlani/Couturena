<p>Let&#8217;s start with a concept. When it comes to sustainability there are a lot of ideas that come to mind. It could mean creating a movement in the fashion industry or changing brands to become more environmentally friendly or even looking at the current fashion industry as a major waste problem that needs fixing. All these thoughts are completely correct however, In order to truly understand what it is you need to realize that sustainability doesn&#8217;t always relate to just the environment.</p>



<p>The definition of sustainability according to google is &#8216; meeting our own needs without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. In addition to natural resources, we also need social and economic resources&#8217;. A common misconception is that only the environment is at stake here when in actual fact there&#8217;s a lot more. </p>



<p>With so many parts to sustainability, there are also a lot of ways we as a community can help. Whether it means raising awarness or dedicating time to learning and helping out, more needs to be done to make sure that as community we do our part.</p>
